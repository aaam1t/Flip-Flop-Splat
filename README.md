# Flip-Flop-Splat
A 2D action-platformer built in PyGame with an innovative gravity-switching mechanic

## About the game

Hello!

This is a game I made for my HSC Software Design & Development class, called 'Flip! Flop! Splat!' (get it, like slip, slop, slap, but flip coz the game's about gravity play hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha XD i'm so funny)

- One of the requirements of the task was that it had to be built in Python with the Pygame library
- The game is largely inspired by 'Gravity Guy'
- This game was built on and off over the course of about 3 months
- All of the game's assets were created by me, with the exception of some of the background music
- The code has got comments throughout, hopefully they sufficiently explain everything

Have fun!

## Useful info

There are two versions of the game - for final submission of the original project, it had to be compiled to an .exe. For that, game saving had to be altered to save to the user directory. Either version of the source code can be run through a Python interpreter, but the standard interpreter version will create the save file in the same directory as the code, whereas the .exe version will create the save file in AppData.
